This is just a bunch of useful javascript snippets written in Prototype.\nThey're on my blog as well, but can easily get lost. Maybe they'll be safe here :^)

* give-links-leading-up-to-existing-page-active-class.js

  This code finds all links that match the URI and add the class "active" to them. It makes showing the user how they got to the page really easy.

  Example URL: http://codequietly.com/projects/websites

  http://codequietly.com/ (active)
  http://codequietly.com/projects (active)
  http://codequietly.com/projects/websites (active)
  http://codequietly.com/contact (no active class)


* open-external-links-in-new-window.js

  This file checks if the link's URL originates from the current domain. If it doesn't, the link will open in a new window.

  Example URL: http://codequietly.com

  http://codequietly.com/contact (open in same window)
  http://codequietly.com/projects (open in same window)
  http://github.com/daneharrigan (open in new window)
